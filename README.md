# My custom Marp themes

[Marp](https://marp.app/) is used to create presentations in Markdown. In this repository, you may find simple CSS themes that I have created. Namely:

## `beam`

````

# Installation

Assuming you're using the VSCode Marp extensionâ€¦

1. Open Settings in VSCode (`Ctrl + ,`)
2. Search for "Marp: Themes" or "markdown.marp.themes"
3. Add either a local or a remote path to the CSS file
   - e.g.: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rnd195/my-marp-themes/live/theme_name.css
4. Enable the theme in the front-matter of the Markdown document, i.e., write the following at the very beginning of the Markdown document:

```
---
marp: true
theme: theme_name
---
```

5. Try restaring VSCode if it doesn't work right away

For additional settings (such as `size` or `paginate`), follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/blob/main/website/docs/guide/directives.md).
